Some notable obstacles I faced was trying to figure out an efficient way to make
the isValidPollString function works.
I first tried to split the pollData string on the ',' character and struggled because
there is no easy way to do this in c++. I eventually found a different way without the need
for arrays.

Program Design:

Library include statements.

stateCode function from spec modified to accept both upper and lowercase state codes.

bool function to check if several consecutive party results are valid:
    iterate through given party results
        check if two numbers are followed by a party character
        or if one number is followed by a party character
        else: invalid.

bool isValidPollString function:
    while true:
        if commas are in given string,
            use up until comma and leave remainder in string.
        else
            no commas, only one forecast.
            if string is empty, break.
        check if state and party results are valid
        if they are, return true. else false.
        break when no characters are left in given string.

countSeats function:
    if party isn't character isn't valid return 2
    if pollString is invalid return 1

    declare variable to store seat count.
    iterate through pollString and find all party characters
        if party characters exist
            find numbers that precede the party character
            convert string numbers to integers
            add integers to counter variable.

main function used to output values for testing.

EOF.

Test data:

Empty string: ""
Comma as first char: ",NY9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4R"
Comma as last char: "NY9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4R,"
Whitespace character in string: "NY9R16D1I, Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4R"
Whitespace character at end: "NY9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4R "
Whitespace character at beginning: " NY9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4R"
Invalid character: "NY9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r.4D,KS4R"
Invalid party: "NY9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4RR"
Invalid state code: "NN9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4R"
Invalid number of seats: "NN9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS444R"
Valid poll string: "NY9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4R"
